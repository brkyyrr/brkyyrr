I’m Berkay from Türkiye, I have been working at the Development Investment Bank of Türkiye. I've been starting to develop myself in the field Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My ultimate goal is to be able to apply the Mathematics that I have pushed myself so hard to learn, which is why I chose Python.
